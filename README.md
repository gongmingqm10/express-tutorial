# Express tutorial
Demo project to learn [Express](http://expressjs.com) which is a popular nodejs web framework. We try to use a simple end-to-end
project together with [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/).

## Generate express scaffold

As Rails web project, you need to install express framework before you want to use it. Please refer to this [instruction](http://expressjs.com/starter/installing.html).

Install express using node
```
npm install express --save
```

Install express-generator

```
npm install express-generator -g
```

Go to your destination folder

```
express .
```

This will generate the scaffold which contains all the necessary directory and the configuration files.

Go to the project root folder

```
npm install & npm start
```

Then you should successfully visit the `http://localhost:3000`
